# Orchestration

So far, we have done the basics on Kubernetes: deploy a simple app
within the cluster.

Now we are going to do an end-to-end deployment in Kubernetes and show
the power of Google Cloud backing it.

In order to do it, you can find [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-orchestrate-with-kubernetes/#0) a comprehensive
guide.

If you have already setup the cluster, go straight to the step 3.

Once you have finished the step 12, call one of us (Luke, Ricardo or
David) to show you few points around what you have done. This is an
abstract exercise and it will be very helpful if someone gives you a
summary of the content.

Don't pay attention to the time specified in the top right corner. 60
minutes it is quite optimistic if you don't have previous experience.
