# Kubernetes 101

This repository is a set of exercises for the Kubernetes 101 workshop.

Please feel free to raise issues and pull requests in order to
collaborate.

The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the most complex one. We
would recommend you to start from the beginning but, if you have some
experience in Kubernetes and Google Cloud, feel free to skip some
exercises. In the end, we want to have fun without getting bored.

We have setup a Google Group in order to help you with questions and
concerns. Here is the address: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-101-dublin


Have fun!
